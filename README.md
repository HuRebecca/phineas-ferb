# Phineas and Ferb Analysis

Because why not?

### Goals

* I want to find out which of the main characters have the most lines/talks the most.
* I want to find out which characters is looking out for Perry the most
* I want to find out which of the characters is the most negative/positive

### Most Talkative Characters

From what's in `analyze_scripts.py` so far, we can see that Candace and Phineas have the most lines, but Doofenshmirtz speaks the most words. This makes sense, because Doofenshmirtz goes on long monologues when explaining his Inators to Perry the Platypus.

We can also see that Ferb is very quiet, speaking the fewest lines and the fewest words of any human character. Not entirely surprising.

What is surprising is how much Monogram speaks relative to the number of lines he has. Must be from giving Perry the Platypus all those missions.
